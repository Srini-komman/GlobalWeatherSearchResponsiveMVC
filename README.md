# GlobalWeatherSearchResponsiveMVC
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Simple Asp.NET MVC application to find the weather details for selected country and the city. AngularJs has been used for the front end data binding and event handling. Depency injection and Unti Tests have been implemented at server side. I will add unit tests at front end and Dependency injection container at backend in next few commits. Happy coding.. </p>
